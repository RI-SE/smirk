# 1 Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>
This document containts the deployment specification for SMIRK â€“ a pedestrian automatic emergency braking (PAEB) system that relies on machine learning (ML). SMIRK is an Advanced driver-assistance system (ADAS), intended to act as one of several systems supporting the driver in the dynamic driving task, i.e., all the real-time operational and tactical functions required to operate a vehicle in on-road traffic.

We develop SMIRK as a demonstrator in a simulated environment provided by ESI Pro-SiVIC.

## 1.1 Purpose ##
This document describes the deployment of SMIRK on the experimental plattform that runs ESI Pro-SiVIC.

## 1.2 Document Conventions ##
Headings with a reference in brackets [X] refer to artifacts mandated by the AMLAS process.

## 1.3 Glossary
- AMLAS: Guidance on the Assurance of Machine Learning in Autonomous Systems
- DM: Data Management
- ML: Machine Learning
- ODD: Operational Design Domain

# 4 ML Deployment Argument Pattern [GG]
The figure below shows the ML deployment argument pattern using GSN. Since SMIRK is developed for a simulated environment, the pattern is adapted accordingly.
