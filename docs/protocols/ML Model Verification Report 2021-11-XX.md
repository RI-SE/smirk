# 1 Introduction
This document documents the results from testing of the ML model used in the object detection component of SMIRK. The independent ML model testing was done by [Infotiv](https://www.infotiv.se/en) engineers who were not involved in the development of the ML model. All results correspond to evaluating ML model output on the Verification Data [P].
